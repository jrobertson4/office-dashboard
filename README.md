# Office Dashboard

This project is a lightweight dashboard intended to be displayed on a TV in the Ziftr office.

The goal is to give the software engineering team added visibility into relevant operational information. Although intended for use at Ziftr it may be useful to other software teams.

## Planned Features

* Cycle through multiple dashboards based on priority.
* Immediately switch to relevant dashboards in realtime when high-priority events happen (such as someone broke the build).

## Planned Dashboards

* Jenkins build status.
* Local weather.
* Google Calendar upcomming events.
* World time.
* Google Analytics traffic data.
* Notifications.
